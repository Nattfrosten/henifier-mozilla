# henifier-mozilla

A firefox extension that turns swedish webpages more politically correct. 
Transforms "Han" and "Hon" to "Hen", also works with "Hennes" etc.
You can also opt to turn "flick-/pojkv√§n" into "partner"
Also supports marking all changed words, so that you know if the text were properly pk from the beginning.
